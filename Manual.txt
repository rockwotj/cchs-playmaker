the title bar and changed under options)

TOOL BAR
To the righthand side of the screen there
are a column of buttons. Each of these buttons
has a tool tip that appears at the bottom right
corner of the screen and it will give exact
directions.

Selection Tool: use this tool to select pieces
already placed. Use the delete key to delete 
and either press enter, double click or right click to 
open a properties window for that piece*.
Also, when a piece is selected use page_up
move that piece to the front so that it is 
drawn over other pieces. and use page_down 
so that it is drawn last and under other 
pieces.

*NOTE: this only works for Zones, players, 
and text boxes.

***I am not adding the buttons because the 
information is in the tooltip***

Add Text: when adding a text enter the
text you want to add in the field below the 
add text button. Then, click on the field 
where you want that text to appear

CHANGE LOG

--------------2.0----------------
1. Default properties are now global and in a 
.config file instead of unique to each file.
2. The button for lines has been combined into
one drop box to lessen the number of options
and to clean the toolbar up.
3. Field pieces now scale to size and position.
4. There are now right click popup menus for the 
same objects that had properties boxes.
5. Players can now have text added to them.
